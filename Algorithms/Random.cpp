 * How Random Number generator works
 * 
 *  There is a black box which has a mathematical equation, to which we initially supply a seed value (a number) which the equation uses to generate a random number now that random number will be used as a seed value and so on..
 * 
 * There are chances that after sometime same seed value is generated which would cause same sequence of numbers, so it is neccessary to choose good seed value.
 * 
 *      seed*(equation) ---> Rand
